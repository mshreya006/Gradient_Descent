# Gradient_Descent
This Python script is a implementation of Gradient Descent algorithm which compares Linear Search and Gradient Descent for optimizing a quadratic function. It generates noisy data based on a quadratic equation and finds the best coefficient (m1) using both methods. Linear Search iterates over a range to find the best m1, while Gradient Descent updates m1 and m2 iteratively using calculated gradients. The script also plots the generated data and visualizes the loss convergence of Gradient Descent.
