# Gradient_Descent
This Python script is a implementation of Gradient Descent algorithm which compares Linear Search and Gradient Descent for optimizing a quadratic function. It generates noisy data based on a quadratic equation and finds the best coefficient (m1) using both methods. The script also plots the generated data and visualizes the loss convergence of Gradient Descent.
